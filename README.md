# The Goat AKA Alphonse AKA [REDACTED]
**Fall 2024**
<br>
Alphonse is a life-size goat made for Ceremony of the Faceless. The goatâ€™s head is a custom 3D printed animatronic, with glowing eyes and a moveable jaw.

The goat needed to be robust enough to be dragged across the stage by an actor and hoisted up onto an altar, and the animatronic head needed to be powered and operated entirely wirelessly, and not lose connection or break while the rest of the goat was being manhandled. We accomplished all of those goals! Alphonse is puppeted remotely with a PS4 controller. We also programmed QLab cues for activating certain effects (like the glowing eyes), and also utilized QLab for a status dashboard to keep an eye on Alphonse's "vitals" (network connectivity) at all times.

# Ceremonial Candles
**Fall 2024**
<br>
Stage candles made for Ceremony of the Faceless. 100 candles were made for the show, each candle is made from PVC, hot glue, and a single LED. The candles are chained together in clusters, with each cluster having one control board connected to the show network over ethernet and powered with PoE (so only one cord to worry about!). Once connected, each candle can be individually controlled, or clusters can be controlled all together in QLab with ArtNet and OSC, to create dynamic lighting effects during the show.

# Charlie-Hulk
**Spring 2024**
<br>
A giant robot face made for A Computer That Loves (And Why Not To Build One). 6 feet tall and 15 feet across, comprised of three separate panels mounted 15 feet above the stage on a truss, with LED grid eyes and mouth, all controlled by QLab over OSC, _and_, a moving animatronic eyeball, remote controlled from across the theater by an operator with a Wii Nunchuk. Charlie-Hulk needed to hit various cues during the show to show different emotions, as well as a dramatic "booting up" sequence that was programmed using QLab. Original concept design by Chris Reuther, all electronics and software by Peter Turnbull and Mace Morningstar.
